Array definition and declaration; recourse to the array(how the array can be used).
Composing a program from external modules:

Arrays in C:
I imagine a row of labeled boxes. Each box holds something of the same typeâ€”like only numbers or only letters.
I set the number of boxes when you create the array.
Each box has a number (its index), starting with 0 for the first box.
I use these numbers to put things into and take things out of the boxes.

Modules in C:
I think of modules as separate sections of your program, like chapters in a book.
.h files are like table of contents, they tell other parts of your code what each module contains.
.c files are like the actual pages of the chapter, they hold the actual code.
Modules help keep my code organized and make it easier to reuse parts of my program.
They make it easier to work on big programs.
