Array definition and declaration; recourse to the array(how the array can be used).
Composing a program from external modules:


Definition and Declaration:
In C, an array represents a data structure that stores a fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same data type.
Declaration involves specifying the data type, an identifier, and the number of elements within square brackets.
For instance, int myArray[10]; allocates a contiguous block of memory capable of storing 10 integer values.
Recourse to the Array (Array Usage):
Array elements are accessed via zero-based indexing.
The index denotes the element's position relative to the array's starting address.
The expression myArray[i] retrieves or modifies the element at index i.

Modular Programming in C: Abstraction and Code Reusability
Composing a Program from External Modules:
Modular programming in C involves partitioning a program into discrete, independent units known as modules.
Each module encapsulates a specific set of functionalities, promoting code organization and maintainability.
Modules typically consist of a header file (.h) and a source file (.c).
The header file declares function prototypes, data structures, and constants, providing an interface for other modules.
The source file implements the functions declared in the header.
The #include enables the inclusion of header files, facilitating access to external module interfaces.

Good because:
Improved code organization and readability.
Enhanced code reusability across projects.
Simplified maintenance and debugging.
